<div class="title">Basic Group Theory in Speed-solving the Rubik's Cube</div>
<div class="speaker">Tarryn Pham | Nov 7, 2019</div>
<p class="description">
    In competitive speed-cubing, competitors try to solve the classic
    3x3 Rubik’s cube as fast as possible. There are a few main methods,
    but by far the most popular method is CFOP, in which the P stands
    for permutation. Using basic group theory, we can understand why
    there are only 21 possible permutations of the last layer- i.e.  all 43
    quintillion+ possible scrambles will be brought to one of the 21
    possible permutations of the last layer (after the first 2 layers are
    solved).  The goal of the talk is to describe cycle decomposition and
    how that is very alike to solving the cube (and actually helps people
    achieve 4-5 second world-record times).

<div class="title">Rudimentary Game Theory</div>
<div class="speaker">Daniel Lee | Jan 23, 2019</div>
<p class="description">
    Game theory is the mathematical study of strategic settings where
    the behavior of one player affects the other. Game theory has
    applications in many fields of social science and can be a useful
    tool for analyzing decision-making of rational groups and
    individuals. Games can range from simple, recreational games like
    tic-tac-toe, to more complex games like the Cournot and Bertrand
    duopoly models in economics.<br>
    <br>
    This talk will introduce basic concepts of game theory and examples
    of different games, in particular, the prisoner's dilemma and the
    rationalizability of cooperation in a repeated prisoner's dilemma.

<div class="title">Teaching Elementary Mathematics</div>
<div class="speaker">Krystopher Weeton | Oct 30, 2018</div>
<p class="description">
    A talk about the methods used to teach mathematics to students in
    elementary school. Topics range from addition of number under ten,
    through factors and multiplication strategies. Focus is on
    elementary strategies, and how to communicate these strategies to
    younger students.

<h5>2017–2018</h5>
<div class="title">Homotopy and the Hopf Fibration</div>
<div class="speaker">Zack Garza | Jun 4, 2018</div>
<p class="description">
    Homotopy theory provides tools for studying topological spaces -
    roughly speaking, the homotopy groups πn(X) of a space X can be
    defined in terms of maps Sn → X from n dimensional spheres into it,
    yielding a method of “probing” a space for n dimensional holes.<br>
    <br>
    This talk will introduce some of the computational and theoretical
    tools used in homotopy theory. It will also cover some of the
    background needed to understand the Hopf Fibration, a map
    constructed by Heinz Hopf in the 1930s which wraps S3 around S2 in a
    nontrivial way. This has led to surprising consequences, including
    the existence of higher homotopy groups of spheres.<br>
    <br>
    (There will also be several visualizations that demonstrate the
    beautiful structure that emerges!)

<div class="title">Systems, Convolution, and Fourier Analysis</div>
<div class="speaker">Eric Gelphman | May 20, 2018</div>
<p class="description">
    We will first show how the response of an nth order linear system
    can be mathematically described by the operation of convolution by
    solving the ODE that describes the response of an nth order linear
    system using a Green’s Function. We will then go over how
    convolution can be transformed into multiplication by the Fourier
    and Laplace transforms. Finally, we will discuss applications to
    both electrical and biological systems.

<div class="title">To infinity and beyond, but why stop there?</div>
<div class="speaker">Jonathan Lim | Mar 1, 2018</div>
<p class="description">
    ”I can’t talk about our love story, so I will talk about math. I am
    not a mathematician, but I know this: There are infinite numbers
    between 0 and 1. There’s .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite
    collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of
    numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities
    are bigger than other infinities.” - John Green Although this
    argument may seem intuitive, when it comes to infinities, there are
    many times when our intuitions are wrong. In fact, the cardinality
    or the size of the interval [0,1], [0,2], and even [0,1,000,000] are
    all the same. Why is this true? Well come out to our next Lightning
    talk about cardinalities for a soft introduction to the puzzling
    idea of infinity and beyond!

<div class="title">Topological Fixed Point Theorems</div>
<div class="speaker">Zack Garza | Mar 1, 2018</div>
<p class="description">
    If you’re ever bored in Math class, try pulling out your calculator,
    putting in a random number, and then start hitting the cosine
    button. Before long, the digits will stop changing, which denotes a
    fixed point of the function. This idea generalizes to different
    kinds of maps and spaces, and using the tools of topology we can
    discover some counter-intuitive results about the world we live in -
    for example, can you ever truly mix a cup of coffee? And is it
    possible for two opposite points on a planet to have the exact same
    temperature and atmospheric pressure? These questions can be
    answered using the Brouwer Fixed-Point theorem and the Borsuk-Ulam
    theorem, which are the topics we’ll be discussing in this talk.

<div class="title">Homology and the Snake Lemma</div>
<div class="speaker">Zack Garza | Nov 20, 2017</div>
<p class="description">
    Homology is an algebraic tool that has proved to be useful in many
    areas of Mathematics, and in recent years has even been used in
    applied settings such as large scale data analysis.<br>
    <br>
    This talk is motivated by the movie “It’s My Turn” from 1980, which
    features an infamous scene involving a result known as “The Snake
    Lemma.” Surprisingly, this scene is mathematically precise, and is
    even referenced as a proof in a text by Weibel’s “Introduction to
    Homological Algebra”!<br>
    <br>
    The goal of this talk will be to provide a brief overview of some of
    the mathematics used in this scene, and ultimately to formulate what
    the Snake Lemma is and an example of how it can be used. In the
    process, we will also cover some of the basics of homology and its
    generalization in homological algebra.

<div class="title">Algebraic Geometry: A Historical Primer</div>
<div class="speaker">Zack Garza | Oct 25, 2017</div>
<p class="description">
    Algebraic Geometry is often touted as an abstruse, difficult to
    penetrate subject - however, these two branches of Mathematics have
    been intertwined since the time of the Greeks! In this talks, we
    will discuss Algebraic Geometry from a historical perspective,
    leading up to a brief, high-level modern overview of “the
    Nullstellensatz”, a theorem which provides a dictionary between the
    worlds of algebra and geometry.

<div class="title">Boolean Fourier Analysis</div>
<div class="speaker">Peter Amidon | May 26, 2017</div>
<p class="description">
    Boolean Fourier Analysis has proven to be a remarkably versatile
    tool in various fields in theoretical computer science. In this talk
    I will introduce the basics of the technique and show how the simple
    change-of-basis that is Fourier analysis can solve many problems. In
    addition I will show a Fourier-analysis based proof of the famous
    Arrow’s Theorem which shows an approximate version of it: if a
    ranked-choice voting system has a high probably of choosing a
    Condorcet winner, then in some way it is “close” to being a
    dictatorship.

<div class="title">Vibrations on a Drumhead</div>
<div class="speaker">Simon Hu | Apr 28, 2017</div>
<p class="description">
    In this talk, we will discuss the problem of vibrations on a
    drum-head. Specifically, we find an analytical solution to the wave
    equation in two dimensions by using Bessel’s functions.<br>
    <br>
    We first derive the Bessel’s function, which is a solution to a
    Second-Order, Linear, Ordinary Differential Equation. Then we
    discuss, shortly, the wave equation and the fundamental solution.
    Finally, we will discuss the problem of vibrations on a drum-head.
    If time permits, we will discuss applications of this problem.

<div class="speaker">Kim Udomprapasup | Mar 17, 2017</div>
<p class="description">
    This talk will discuss the mathematical theory of Brownian motion.
    We will begin with the description of Brownian motion, then move on
    to some of its interesting properties. Its connections to other
    areas in mathematics will also be mentioned, for example, harmonic
    analysis and PDE.<br>
    <br>
    If time permits, we will get a glimpse of stochastic calculus as
    well.

<div class="title">The Galilean Group and Mechanics, both Classical and Quantum</div>
<div class="speaker">David Moore | Feb 24, 2017</div>
<p class="description">
    This talk will discuss the mathematical formulation of
    nonrelativistic classical and quantum mechanics. Both boil down to
    ordinary and partial differential equations, and both possess the
    galilean group as their symmetry group.<br>
    <br>
    We will start at the group and its corresponding Lie algebra,
    introduce the Poisson bracket (classical) and commutator (quantum),
    and derive some implications of the bracket + symmetry group laws.
    Throughout, we will stick as close as possible to differential
    equations, and ignore or tread around any functional analysis issues
    that crop up.
</p>

<div class="title">Category Theory as an Organization Tool</div>
<div class="speaker">Zack Garza | Jan 27, 2017</div>
<p class="description">
    This talk will continue some of the ideas introduced in last
    quarter’s talks on Category Theory. (We’ll also review some of the
    basics for people that didn’t make the first one.) The focus this
    time will be to see a number of examples of how Category Theory ties
    together various branches of branches of Mathematics.<br>
    <br>
    We’ll cover many of the structures seen in undergraduate classes
    like Analysis, Algebra, Combinatorics, and Topology, and how they
    are related to each other. I’ll also be explaining what the term
    “isomorphism” means in all of these contexts.

<div class="title">Math Jokes by Physicists: fractal dimension, random walks, the Ising model, and the continuum limit</div>
<div class="speaker">David Moore | Dec 2, 2016</div>
<p class="description">
    Efforts in statistical field theory - a physics subject similar to
    quantum field theory - are plagued with infinities. In this talk I
    will outline the path from fractals and self-avoiding random walks,
    to the Ising model and its ilk. This involves hilarities like the
    scrubbing away of infinities, limits as integers approach zero, and
    the path integral.

<div class="title">Matroids and Greedy Algorithms</div>
<div class="speaker">Abel Mariam | Dec 2, 2016</div>
<p class="description">
    There are a class of algorithms referred to as Greedy algorithms
    which are broadly characterized by the strategy of “picking what
    looks best at the moment”. It turns out that the theory of matroids
    provides the appropriate framework to partially characterize
    problems that have a greedy solution. A matroid, first introduced in
    1935 by Hassler Whitney, is a combinatorial structures that
    generalizes the notion of independence common in many different
    areas of mathematics.<br>
    <br>
    In this talk, I will introduce some basic definitions and results
    and discuss Matroid formulations of some classic problems in Graph
    Theory (Minimum Spanning Tree, Vertex Matching, and Interval
    Scheduling).
