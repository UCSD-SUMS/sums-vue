# Talks

A lightning talk is a short presentation meant to quickly introduce a topic or concept to an audience.
At SUMS, we host lightning talks related to mathematics and related fields and industries.
In other words, if your talk is marginally related to math, we'd love to host your talk!

SUMS lightning talks typically last anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour.
Anyone can give a lightning talk, including undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff.
Attendance is open to the public.

## Give a Talk

If you'd like to give a talk, please sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefEvAMlDd06Jf318iMdYKPk83VB35xaj89zQL2VZFoyOKklA/viewform).

After filling out the form, all you'll have to do is present your talk.
We can take care of event logistics and publicity for you!

#### "Local and Global Principle Orientation of Number Theory" by *Tomoki Oda*

<time datetime="2020-11-10">November 10, 2020</time>

How can we distinguish between the relations \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\) and \\(x^2 + y^2 = 3\\)?
Geometrically speaking, they only differ in scale.
How about in terms of rational solutions?
The relation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\) has an obvious rational solution of \\((1, 0)\\), and another solution \\((3/5, 4/5)\\) which makes use of Pythagorean triples.
In fact, there are infinitely many rational solutions!
What about the relation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 3\\)?
We probably have not learnt of any rational solutions on this circle, and indeed there are no rational solutions!!
There are a variety of ways to explain why the rational solutions do not exist, but we shall be taking a Number Theory approach - one of the explanations is through Local and Global Principal by Hasse!
This talk does not require any fancy knowledge of mathematics, but just curiosity!
Let's discuss one of the deepest results of modern mathematics!

#### "Machine Learning" by *Yi Fu*

<time datetime="2019-12-04">December 4, 2019</time>

The first talk of a three-quarter series on Machine Learning, which will introduce students in math major to the theoretical framework behind machine learning techniques and provide insights about the application of upper-division math courses.
Topics will include an introduction to machine learning, linear regression models, dimensionality reduction techniques (Principal Component Analysis, Laplacian eigenfunction).
