# Talks

A lightning talk is a short presentation meant to quickly introduce a topic or concept to an audience.
At SUMS, we host lightning talks related to mathematics and related fields and industries.
In other words, if your talk is marginally related to math, we'd love to host your talk!

SUMS lightning talks typically last anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour.
Anyone can give a lightning talk, including undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff.
Attendance is open to the public.

## Give a Talk

After filling out the form, all you'll have to do is present your talk.
We can take care of event logistics and publicity for you!

## Past Talks

### 2022-2023 

#### "A (non) Mathematical Approach to Puzzles" by *Ryan Batubara*

<time datetime = "2023-02-23"> February 23, 2023 </time> 

Puzzles are interesting as they often force players to rethink what they already know. This lightning talk focuses on simple mathematical puzzles that make us rethink how we use mathematics to abstract problems. No prior mathematical knowledge required.

#### "Connecting the Dots: Chebyshev Polynomial Interpolation" by *Aidan Epperly*

<time datetime = "2022-10-20"> October 19, 2022 </time> 

Polynomial approximation is a cornerstone of approximation theory, a widely applicable field of mathematics. Interpolation, a method of polynomial approximation, often gets a bad rap for being slow or inaccurate. Luckily, all of these problems, and more, can be solved using the wonderful world of Chebyshev polynomials and their surprising connection with Fourier series!

### 2021-2022

#### "Lebesgue Measurable Sets" by *Andrew Paul*

<time datetime = "2022-05-13"> May 13, 2022</time>

The interval <Math>(0,1) \subseteq\mathbb{R}</Math> clearly has length <Math>1</Math>, and the set <Math>(0,1)\cup(-4,-2)\subseteq\mathbb{R}</Math> clearly has length <Math>3</Math>, but what can we say about the lengths of more esoteric subsets of <Math>\mathbb{R}</Math>, such as <Math>\mathbb{Q}\subseteq\mathbb{R}</Math>? Lebesgue measure gives us a way to assign lengths to more exotic subsets of the real numbers, generalizing the intuitive notion of "length". While explicitly constructing Lebesgue measure is technically challenging and best left to a class on measure theory, it is much more tractable to discuss the nuances of the different types of subsets we are able to assign a length to. We will see that the axiom of choice forces us to restrict the collection of Lebesgue measurable sets to a so-called <Math>\sigma</Math>-<Math>{algebra}</Math> that is properly contained in the power set of <Math>\mathbb{R}</Math>. Despite this, there are still many interesting Lebesgue measurable sets. We will study some of these sets and explore the subtle relationship between measure-theoretic, set-theoretic, and topological notions of "size".

#### "Kakeya Needle Problem" by *James Wong*

<time datetime="2022-02-28">February 28, 2022</time>

A hundred years ago, Soichi Kakeya posed a question on the existence of a 2D shape of minimum size such that one can fit a unit line segment of any orientation into said shape.
As it turns out, there is no such shape of minimal area because one can construct arbitrarily small shapes with the aforementioned property.

We shall see in this talk that there are deeper implications of the existence of such shapes - namely, how they can be used to construct certain counterexamples that can help broaden our understanding of the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem, and Fourier Multiplier Theory.

### 2020-2021

#### "Algebraic Integers and Integer Sequences Lightning Talk" by *Michael Bradley*

<time datetime="2021-02-15">February 15, 2021</time>

Many mathematicians have a keen interest in *integer sequences*.
For a real world example of this interest, see the [*On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)*](https://oeis.org), an easily searchable archive of the sequences mathematicians have considered most interesting.
The *Fibonacci numbers* are an example of an integer sequence defined by a relatively simple recursive relation <Math>F_{n+1} = F_{n-1} + F_n</Math>.
Many people have heard that the ratio of successive Fibonacci numbers approaches the *golden ratio*, a member of a class of numbers called the *algebraic integers*.
This hints at a deeper relationship between the Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio.
But even more, this hints at a deeper relationship between certain integer sequences and algebraic integers generally.
This lightning talk will explore these relationships in a way that is both casual and detailed.

#### "Differential Geometry Lite with Mathematica" by *Parsia Hedayat*

<time datetime="2021-02-11">February 11, 2020</time>

When we want to study the geometric properties of objects in some kind of space, how should we go about it?
What branch of math might we look to first for help?
In this talk, you’ll learn the basics of Differential Geometry, supplemented with graphics in Mathematica, to get a grasp of how Calculus and Linear Algebra can be used to solve problems regarding geometry.
The topics to be covered will be curves and surfaces.

#### "Local and Global Principle Orientation of Number Theory" by *Tomoki Oda*

<time datetime="2020-11-10">November 10, 2020</time>

How can we distinguish between the relations <Math>x^2 + y^2 = 1</Math> and <Math>x^2 + y^2 = 3</Math>?
Geometrically speaking, they only differ in scale.
How about in terms of rational solutions?
The relation <Math>x^2 + y^2 = 1</Math> has an obvious rational solution of <Math>(1, 0)</Math>, and another solution <Math>(3/5, 4/5)</Math> which makes use of Pythagorean triples.
In fact, there are infinitely many rational solutions!
What about the relation <Math>x^2 + y^2 = 3</Math>?
We probably have not learnt of any rational solutions on this circle, and indeed there are no rational solutions!!
There are a variety of ways to explain why the rational solutions do not exist, but we shall be taking a Number Theory approach - one of the explanations is through Local and Global Principal by Hasse!
This talk does not require any fancy knowledge of mathematics, but just curiosity!
Let's discuss one of the deepest results of modern mathematics!

### 2019-2020



#### "Machine Learning" by *Yi Fu*

<time datetime="2019-12-04">December 4, 2019</time>

The first talk of a three-quarter series on Machine Learning, which will introduce students in math major to the theoretical framework behind machine learning techniques and provide insights about the application of upper-division math courses.
Topics will include an introduction to machine learning, linear regression models, dimensionality reduction techniques (Principal Component Analysis, Laplacian eigenfunction).

#### "Basic Group Theory in Dpeed-solving the Rubik's Cube" by *Tarryn Pham*

<time datetime = "2019-11-07"> November 7, 2019</time>

In competitive speed-cubing, competitors try to solve the classic
3x3 Rubik’s cube as fast as possible. There are a few main methods,
but by far the most popular method is CFOP, in which the P stands
for permutation. Using basic group theory, we can understand why
there are only 21 possible permutations of the last layer- i.e.  all 43
quintillion+ possible scrambles will be brought to one of the 21
possible permutations of the last layer (after the first 2 layers are
solved).  The goal of the talk is to describe cycle decomposition and
how that is very alike to solving the cube (and actually helps people
achieve 4-5 second world-record times).

### 2018-2019

#### "Rudimentary Game Theory" by *Daniel Lee*

<time datetime = "2019-01-23"> January 23, 2019</time>

Game theory is the mathematical study of strategic settings where
the behavior of one player affects the other. Game theory has
applications in many fields of social science and can be a useful
tool for analyzing decision-making of rational groups and
individuals. Games can range from simple, recreational games like
tic-tac-toe, to more complex games like the Cournot and Bertrand
duopoly models in economics.

This talk will introduce basic concepts of game theory and examples
of different games, in particular, the prisoner's dilemma and the
rationalizability of cooperation in a repeated prisoner's dilemma.

---

#### "Teaching Elementary Mathematics" by *Krystopher Weeton*

<time datetime = "2018-10-30"> October 30, 2018</time>

A talk about the methods used to teach mathematics to students in
elementary school. Topics range from addition of number under ten,
through factors and multiplication strategies. Focus is on
elementary strategies, and how to communicate these strategies to
younger students.

### 2017-2018


#### "Homotopy and the Hopf Fibration" by *Zack Garza*

<time datetime = "2018-06-04">June 4, 2018 </time>

Homotopy theory provides tools for studying topological spaces - roughly speaking, the homotophy groups <Math> \pi n(X) </Math> of a space <Math> X </Math>
can be defined in terms of maps <Math> S_{n} \rightarrow X </Math> from <Math> n </Math> dimensional spheres into it, yielding a method of "probing" a space 
for <Math>n</Math> dimensional holes. 

This talk will introduce some of the computational and theoretical tools used in homotopy theory. It will also cover some of the background needed to
understand the Hobpf Fibration, a map constructed by Heinz Hopf in the 1930s which wraps <Math> S_{3} </Math> around <Math> S_{2} </Math> in a nontrivial way. 
This has led to surprising consequences, including the existence of higher homotopy groups of spheres. 

There will also be several visualizations that demonstrate the structure that emerges!

---

#### "Systems, Convolution, and Fourier Analysis" by *Eric Gelphman*

<time datetime = 2018-05-18> May 20, 2018 </time> 

We will first show how the response of an <Math> nth </Math> order linear system can be mathematically described by the operation of convolution by 
solving the ODE that describes the response of an <Math> nth </Math> order linear system using a Green's Function. We will then go over how
convolution can be transformed into multiplication by the Fourier and Laplace transforms. Finally, we will discuss applications to both electrical
and biological systems.

#### "To infinity and beyond, but why stop there?" by *Jonathan Lim*</div> 

<time datetime = 2018-03-01>March 1, 2018</time> 

> I can't talk about our love story, so I will talk about math. I am not a mathematician, but I know this: There are infinite numbers between <Math> 0 </Math> and <Math> 1</Math>. 
> There's <Math>0.1</Math> and <Math>0.12</Math> and <Math>0.112</Math> and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between <Math> 0 </Math> and <Math> 2 </Math>, or 
> between <Math> 0 </Math> and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. 

-John Green

Although this argument may seem intuitive, when it comes to infinites, there are many times when our intuitions are wrong. In face, the cardinality or the size of the interval <Math> [0,1], [0,2] </Math>, and
even <Math> [0, 1.000.000] </Math> are all the same. Why is this true? Well come out to our next Lightning talk about cardinalities for a soft introductions to the puzzling idea of infinity and beyond!

#### "Topological Fixed Point Theorems" by *Zack Garza*

<time datetime = 2018-03-01> March 1, 2018 </time> 

If you’re ever bored in Math class, try pulling out your calculator,
putting in a random number, and then start hitting the cosine
button. Before long, the digits will stop changing, which denotes a
fixed point of the function. This idea generalizes to different
kinds of maps and spaces, and using the tools of topology we can
discover some counter-intuitive results about the world we live in -
for example, can you ever truly mix a cup of coffee? And is it
possible for two opposite points on a planet to have the exact same
temperature and atmospheric pressure? These questions can be
answered using the Brouwer Fixed-Point theorem and the Borsuk-Ulam
theorem, which are the topics we’ll be discussing in this talk.

#### "Homology and the Snake Lemma" by *Zack Garza* 

<time datetime = 2017-22-10> November 20, 2017 </time> 

Homology is an algebraic tool that has proved to be useful in many
areas of Mathematics, and in recent years has even been used in
applied settings such as large scale data analysis.
  
This talk is motivated by the movie “It’s My Turn” from 1980, which
features an infamous scene involving a result known as “The Snake
Lemma.” Surprisingly, this scene is mathematically precise, and is
even referenced as a proof in a text by Weibel’s “Introduction to
Homological Algebra”!
  
The goal of this talk will be to provide a brief overview of some of
the mathematics used in this scene, and ultimately to formulate what
the Snake Lemma is and an example of how it can be used. In the
process, we will also cover some of the basics of homology and its
generalization in homological algebra.

#### "Algebraic Geometry: A Historical Primer" by *Zack Garza*

<time datetime = 2017-10-25> October 25, 2017

Algebraic Geometry is often touted as an abstruse, difficult to
penetrate subject - however, these two branches of Mathematics have
been intertwined since the time of the Greeks! In this talks, we
will discuss Algebraic Geometry from a historical perspective,
leading up to a brief, high-level modern overview of “the
Nullstellensatz”, a theorem which provides a dictionary between the
worlds of algebra and geometry.

### 2016-2017


#### "Boolean Fourier Analysis" by *Peter Amidon*

<time datetime = 2017-05-26> May 26, 2017</time> 

Boolean Fourier Analysis has proven to be a remarkably versatile
tool in various fields in theoretical computer science. In this talk
I will introduce the basics of the technique and show how the simple
change-of-basis that is Fourier analysis can solve many problems. In
addition I will show a Fourier-analysis based proof of the famous
Arrow’s Theorem which shows an approximate version of it: if a
ranked-choice voting system has a high probably of choosing a
Condorcet winner, then in some way it is “close” to being a
dictatorship.

---

#### "Vibrations on a Drumhead"by *Simon Hu* 

<time datetime = 17-04-28>April 28, 2017 <time> 

In this talk, we will discuss the problem of vibrations on a
drum-head. Specifically, we find an analytical solution to the wave
equation in two dimensions by using Bessel’s functions.
 
We first derive the Bessel’s function, which is a solution to a
Second-Order, Linear, Ordinary Differential Equation. Then we
discuss, shortly, the wave equation and the fundamental solution.
Finally, we will discuss the problem of vibrations on a drum-head.
If time permits, we will discuss applications of this problem.

---

#### "Brownian Motion" by *Kim Udomprapasup*

<time datetime = 2017-03-17> March 17, 2017 </time>

This talk will discuss the mathematical theory of Brownian motion.
We will begin with the description of Brownian motion, then move on
to some of its interesting properties. Its connections to other
areas in mathematics will also be mentioned, for example, harmonic
analysis and PDE.

If time permits, we will get a glimpse of stochastic calculus as
well.

---

#### "Introduction to Category Theory, Part 2" by *Zack Garza*

<time datetime = 2017-02-24>February 24, 2017</time> 

Initial and terminal objects, products and coproducts, use of
universal property in quotient and polynomial ring constructions,
pullbacks/pushforwards, adjunction, monoids, monads.

---

#### "The Galilean Group and Mechanics, both Classical and Quantum" by *David Moore*

<time datetime = 2017-02-24>February 24, 2017</time> 

This talk will discuss the mathematical formulation of
nonrelativistic classical and quantum mechanics. Both boil down to
ordinary and partial differential equations, and both possess the
galilean group as their symmetry group.

We will start at the group and its corresponding Lie algebra,
introduce the Poisson bracket (classical) and commutator (quantum),
and derive some implications of the bracket + symmetry group laws.
Throughout, we will stick as close as possible to differential
equations, and ignore or tread around any functional analysis issues
that crop up.

---

#### "Category Theory as an Organization Tool" by *Zack Garza* 

<time datetime = 2017-01-27> January 27, 2017 </time> 

This talk will continue some of the ideas introduced in last
quarter’s talks on Category Theory. (We’ll also review some of the
basics for people that didn’t make the first one.) The focus this
time will be to see a number of examples of how Category Theory ties
together various branches of branches of Mathematics.
    
We’ll cover many of the structures seen in undergraduate classes
like Analysis, Algebra, Combinatorics, and Topology, and how they
are related to each other. I’ll also be explaining what the term
“isomorphism” means in all of these contexts.

#### "Math Jokes by Physicists: fractal dimension, random walks, the Ising model, and the continuum limit" by *David Moore*

<time datetime = 2016-12-02> December 2, 2016 </time> 

Efforts in statistical field theory - a physics subject similar to
quantum field theory - are plagued with infinities. In this talk I
will outline the path from fractals and self-avoiding random walks,
to the Ising model and its ilk. This involves hilarities like the
scrubbing away of infinities, limits as integers approach zero, and
the path integral.

---

#### "Matroids and Greedy Algorithms" by *Abel Mariam*

<time datetime = 2016-12-02> December 2, 2016 </time> 

There are a class of algorithms referred to as Greedy algorithms
which are broadly characterized by the strategy of “picking what
looks best at the moment”. It turns out that the theory of matroids
provides the appropriate framework to partially characterize
problems that have a greedy solution. A matroid, first introduced in
1935 by Hassler Whitney, is a combinatorial structures that
generalizes the notion of independence common in many different
areas of mathematics.
 
In this talk, I will introduce some basic definitions and results
and discuss Matroid formulations of some classic problems in Graph
Theory (Minimum Spanning Tree, Vertex Matching, and Interval
Scheduling).

---

#### "Haskell for Mathematics" by *Zack Garza*

Basic of Haskell syntax and semantics, using examples from
Mathematics. Topics: types, functions, lazy evaluation, partial
application/currying, custom datatypes/records, common paradigms in
functional programming (map/filter/reduce), overview of Prelude &
Hackage.

---

#### "Introduction to Category Theory, Part 1" by *Zack Garza* 

<time datetime = 2016-09-30> September 30, 2016</time> 

Motivation and history, basic definitions, examples of categories,
overview of big ideas (commuting diagrams, universal properties,
functors, naturality, duality, limits/colimits, Yoneda).

---

#### "The Next Greatest Number" by *Matt Chan*

<time datetime = 2016-09-30> September 30, 2016</time> 

Basics of point-free style programming (i.e. programming by function
composition) and equational reasoning. How to derive a solution to a
typical CS interview brain teaser by equational reasoning in
Haskell, and how to transform the derived algorithm into an
efficient one by calculation.
