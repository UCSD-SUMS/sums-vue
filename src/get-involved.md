# Get Involved

In case of conflicting information, the [constitution](#constitution) takes priority.

## Volunteering

If you would like to help run our events, we post event volunteer opportunities on [Slack](https://ucsdsums.slack.com/).

## Becoming a Member

Anyone can attend our events but an eligible student may become a SUMS member for additional benefits.

## Becoming a Staff Member

A SUMS member may become a staff member for further involvement with SUMS.

Staff members help officers run the organization and often become elected as officers in the future.
