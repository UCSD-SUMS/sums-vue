# Algebraic Integers and Integer Sequences Lightning Talk

*Michael Bradley* will be giving a lightning talk on **Monday (2/15) from 4-5pm**.
Zoom meeting ID is [967 9007 6961](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/96790076961).

Many mathematicians have a keen interest in *integer sequences*.
For a real world example of this interest, see the [*On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)*](https://oeis.org), an easily searchable archive of the sequences mathematicians have considered most interesting.
The *Fibonacci numbers* are an example of an integer sequence defined by a relatively simple recursive relation <Math>F_{n+1} = F_{n-1} + F_n</Math>.
Many people have heard that the ratio of successive Fibonacci numbers approaches the *golden ratio*, a member of a class of numbers called the *algebraic integers*.
This hints at a deeper relationship between the Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio.
But even more, this hints at a deeper relationship between certain integer sequences and algebraic integers generally.
This lightning talk will explore these relationships in a way that is both casual and detailed.
