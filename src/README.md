# SUMS Movie Night

Come join us for a mathematical movie!
On **Friday, April 16**, from **6-8:30pm**, we will be watching *A Beautiful Mind*.
*A Beautiful Mind* is a 2001 American biographical drama film based on the life of the American mathematician John Nash, a Nobel Laureate in Economics and Abel Prize winner.
The story begins in Nash's days as a graduate student at Princeton University.
Early in the film, Nash begins to develop paranoid schizophrenia and endures delusional episodes while watching the burden his condition brings on his wife Alicia and friends.
