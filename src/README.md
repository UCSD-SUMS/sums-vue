A new [Lightning Talk](talks.md) is being hosted by SUMS on **November 10 @ 2pm PST**!

### "Local and Global Principle Orientation of Number Theory" by Tomoki Oda

*Zoom Meeting Id: [998 2937 8099](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/99829378099)*

How can we distinguish between the relations \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\) and \\(x^2 + y^2 = 3\\)?
Geometrically speaking, they only differ in scale.
How about in terms of rational solutions?
The relation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\) has an obvious rational solution of \\((1, 0)\\), and another solution \\((3/5, 4/5)\\) which makes use of Pythagorean triples.
In fact, there are infinitely many rational solutions!
What about the relation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 3\\)?
We probably have not learnt of any rational solutions on this circle, and indeed there are no rational solutions!!
There are a variety of ways to explain why the rational solutions do not exist, but we shall be taking a Number Theory approach - one of the explanations is through Local and Global Principal by Hasse!
This talk does not require any fancy knowledge of mathematics, but just curiosity!
Let's discuss one of the deepest results of modern mathematics!
