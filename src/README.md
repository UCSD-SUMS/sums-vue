# Differential Geometry Lite with Mathematica

Parsia Hedayat will be presenting a Lightning Talk **tonight** (Thursday, 2/11) from **5:30-6:30pm**.
When we want to study the geometric properties of objects in some kind of space, how should we go about it?
What branch of math might we look to first for help?
In this talk, you’ll learn the basics of Differential Geometry, supplemented with graphics in Mathematica, to get a grasp of how Calculus and Linear Algebra can be used to solve problems regarding geometry.
The topics to be covered will be curves and surfaces.

Join at the Zoom meeting [971 2319 7184](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/97123197184).
